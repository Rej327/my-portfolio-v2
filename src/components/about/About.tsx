					Hi! Iâ€™m Jefferson Resurreccion, 26 years old, a Front-End
					Developer with two years of freelance experience
					specializing in modern JavaScript frameworks, particularly
					React.js, Next.js, and React Native.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a strong foundation in building interactive,
					high-performance, and user-friendly web applications. My
					expertise includes developing responsive and optimized UI
					components using Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, and Mantine UI.
					Additionally, I have a fundamental understanding of backend
					development using firebase, PHP and PHP frameworks such as
					CodeIgniter
				</p>
				<p>
					To solidify my skills, I attended an almost four-month
					intensive training at Village 88, where I gained hands-on
					experience in full-stack web development. This training
					deepened my expertise in modern front-end frameworks,
					backend technologies, and industry best practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my studies to become a frontend developer I've
					learned a lot and I am continuously learning and expanding
					my capabilities to become a good developer so that it will
					increase my skills and as well as become a productive
					employee of the company that I will be working with.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my intensive four-month training at Village 88, I
					completed 213 coding assignments covering both front-end and
					back-end development, which strengthened my technical
					expertise in modern web technologies.
