					graduated from Southern Luzon State University year 2019

					Computer Technology.

					On October 2022 I started my study for being a Front-End
					Developer and learned many programming languages and
					programming technology. As of now my goal is to become a
					Front-End developer and soon is to become a Full Stack
					Developer.
